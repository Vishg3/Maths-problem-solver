# Maths-problem-solver

Streamlit app that functions as a math problem solver. It uses tools like Wikipedia for topic-based information, a calculator tool for solving math expressions, and a reasoning tool for logic-based questions. The app is powered by a Groq-based agent that handles user queries, fetches relevant information from these tools, and provides detailed, point-by-point answers. The chatbot maintains conversation history and generates responses in real time when users enter math-related questions.
